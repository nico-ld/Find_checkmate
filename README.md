# find all checkmate

### Why ?
For improve my algo skill and test me and my pc.

### Why C_algo branch ?
Because I do it in C to learn this language, but after that, I will make the same in other language, like Python, assembler, and why not in B ?

### How it works ?
Using a simple backtrack algorithm, I will check all possibilities for each move over a maximum of five moves. If I find a more optimal way to do this, I will do it that way. But for now, this is the simplest way I have found.
