# Find all checkmates

### Why ?
For improve my algo skill and test me and my pc.

### Why C_algo branch ?
That will change

### How it works ?
Using a simple backtrack algorithm, I will check all possibilities for each move over a maximum of five moves (for the moment). If I find a more optimal way to do this, I will do it that way. But for now, this is the simplest way I have found.
