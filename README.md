# Find all checkmates

### Why this project ?
In fact I just want to test myself and my pc. But this kind of project allows me above all to improve my knowledge on dev. Completing this project is not a priority for me, I only work on it in my spare time.

### How it works ?
For now, I’m going to carry out this project using a backtracking algorithm. It was the first thing that came to mind. However, I don’t rule out the possibility of looking for more efficient algorithms in the future.

### How use it ?
To run the program, you need to enter your position in the file chessboard.txt (if the file doesn’t exist, the program will create one). 
You will also need to provide the following information: who is to play? Who can castle? If a pawn has moved two squares, on which square is it? For a clearer example, a help.txt file is available, and the valid formats for writing the position are also listed there.

Once this is done, run launcher.bat; a result.txt file will appear once the algorithm has finished.
